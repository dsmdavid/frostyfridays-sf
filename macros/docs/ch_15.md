## My solution:
- Create a base table to insert the values.
- Create a [python udf](https://github.com/dsmdavid/frostyfridays-sf/blob/main/macros/ch_15_create_udf.sql) as a post_hook for the first table.
- Create a second view with buckets.

I also added some additional prices below the minimal threshold for edge cases (and assign a bin value of 0)

## the prompt
Week 15 – Intermediate

This week we’re working with small dataset about house sales that needs to be categorized according to certain sliding bins. The catch however , is that the sizes and the number of bins can change quickly.

The challenge is to create a function with a single name that can handle uneven bin sizes , and a changing number of bins. The number of bins to be handled should be between 2 and 6.

The query should look like the following :
```
SELECT sale_date,
       price,
       your_function(price,<your buckets sizes and/or numbers>) AS BUCKET_SET1,
       your_function(price,<your buckets sizes and/or numbers>) AS BUCKET_SET2,
       your_function(price,<your buckets sizes and/or numbers>) AS BUCKET_SET3,
FROM home_sales
```

Setup code:
```
create table home_sales (
sale_date date,
price number(11, 2)
);

insert into home_sales (sale_date, price) values
(‘2013-08-01’::date, 290000.00),
(‘2014-02-01’::date, 320000.00),
(‘2015-04-01’::date, 399999.99),
(‘2016-04-01’::date, 400000.00),
(‘2017-04-01’::date, 470000.00),
(‘2018-04-01’::date, 510000.00);
```
### Result

Given the following buckets 
![buckets](https://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-1.png)
, the following results should be generated:
