## My solution:  
- Create a notification integration.
- Create an alert.
  

## the prompt  
As our database has continued to expand dramatically this week, we’ve come to a critical juncture where it’s become painfully obvious we cannot personally monitor all processes concurrently. It’s as though we’re in a growing city, bustling with data, where we can’t be on every street corner at once.

The remedy to this growing city’s dilemma is to build an infrastructure that will keep us informed and ahead of any possible issues. We need a system of checks, almost like our own automated patrol units, offering notifications and alerts to ensure everything is running smoothly.

Our mission for this week is akin to building a guardian for our city: we require an automated system that sends us a single email alert whenever a query takes more than a minute. Picture this as a vigilant sentinel, promptly reporting when there’s a delay in the usual flow of our database traffic. That’s the challenge, and the key to making our database city more efficient, we have ahead of us this week.

In short :

Create a mechanism that sends out an email if a query takes longer than 1 minute (or any amount of time that you specify).
