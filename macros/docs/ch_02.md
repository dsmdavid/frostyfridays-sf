## My solution:
Use the macro from week 1 to create a new stage with parquet filetype.
Create a table from the file.
Create a view with the desired columns to track.
Use a post-hook in the view to...
1. create the stream.
2. update the underlying table.

## the prompt
Week 2 – Intermediate
Posted on 2022-07-15 by Christopher Marland
A stakeholder in the HR department wants to do some change-tracking but is concerned that the stream which was created for them gives them too much info they don’t care about.

Load in the parquet data and transform it into a table, then create a stream that will only show us changes to the DEPT and JOB_TITLE columns. 

You can find the parquet data here.

Execute the following commands:
```
UPDATE <table_name> SET COUNTRY = 'Japan' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 8;
UPDATE <table_name> SET LAST_NAME = 'Forester' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 22;
UPDATE <table_name> SET DEPT = 'Marketing' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 25;
UPDATE <table_name> SET TITLE = 'Ms' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 32;
UPDATE <table_name> SET JOB_TITLE = 'Senior Financial Analyst' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 68;
```
