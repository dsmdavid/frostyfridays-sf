## My solution:
- Create an initial model that creates the memoizable function if a variable is passed at runtime.
- Create a second model that uses the same function
- Create a third model that uses the same SQL as the function
- Create a fourth model that, again, uses the same SQL as the function
- Check query profiles & execution.

The Challenge
With the news about Snowflake Summit ramping up, I’d like to take a look at a feature that was announced at the last Summit: Memoizable functions

Now, these functions allow your functions to make use of the cache!  
The benefit of using a memoizable function is to improve performance for complex queries, such as multiple-column lookups in mapping tables referenced within a row access policy or masking policy.

We’re starting everyone off easy though to simple find a number that can be used more often. For this we’re using a sample dataset that should be in your account. If you don’t have access , the code below the challenge to get access :
– Use the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF100 Sample dataset  
– Create a memoizable function that returns the Revenue ( Extended_Price with taking into account the given discount) for the European Region.
