## My solution:  
- Create an initial model that creates the memoizable function if a variable is passed at runtime.
- Create a second model that uses the same function
- Create a third model that uses the same SQL as the function
- Create a fourth model that, again, uses the same SQL as the function
- Check query profiles & execution.
  
The function:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION {% raw %}{{ target.database }}{% endraw %}.{% raw %}{{ target.schema }}{% endraw %}.ch40_revenue_europe()  
    RETURNS NUMBER(38,6)  
    MEMOIZABLE  
    AS  
    $$  
    SELECT  
        sum(  
            l.l_quantity * (l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount))  
        )  
        AS revenue  
    FROM {% raw %}{{ source('snowflake_sample_data', 'lineitem') }}{% endraw %} AS l  
        INNER JOIN {% raw %}{{ source('snowflake_sample_data', 'orders') }}{% endraw %} AS o  
            ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey   
        INNER JOIN {% raw %}{{ source('snowflake_sample_data', 'customer') }}{% endraw %} AS c  
            ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey  
        INNER JOIN {% raw %}{{ source('snowflake_sample_data', 'nation') }}{% endraw %} AS n  
            ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey  
        INNER JOIN {% raw %}{{ source('snowflake_sample_data', 'region') }}{% endraw %} AS r  
            ON n.n_regionkey = r.r_regionkey  
    WHERE r.r_name = 'EUROPE'  
    $$
```

The Challenge  
With the news about Snowflake Summit ramping up, I’d like to take a look at a feature that was announced at the last Summit: Memoizable functions  

Now, these functions allow your functions to make use of the cache!  
The benefit of using a memoizable function is to improve performance for complex queries, such as multiple-column lookups in mapping tables referenced within a row access policy or masking policy.

We’re starting everyone off easy though to simple find a number that can be used more often. For this we’re using a sample dataset that should be in your account. If you don’t have access , the code below the challenge to get access :  
– Use the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF100 Sample dataset  
– Create a memoizable function that returns the Revenue ( Extended_Price with taking into account the given discount) for the European Region.
