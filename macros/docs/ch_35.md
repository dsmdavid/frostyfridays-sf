## My solution:

- Macro that creates the stage and the external table if they do not exist.
- Create an additional view on top


## the prompt
Want to learn how to create external tables? Or if you already know, want to show off the fact?

Take the below code:

```
create stage external_table_stage
	url = 's3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_35/';
```
Create an external table called frosty_et from the above stage and when you run the following query:
```
select sale_month,
	id,
        drug_name,
        amount_sold
from frosty_et
order by amount_sold;
```
It should look like the below:
