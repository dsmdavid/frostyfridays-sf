## My solution:

## the prompt
Week 10 – Hard
Frosty Consulting has a client who wants to be able to load data from a stage in a manual but dynamic fashion. To be more specific they want to be able to:  

- execute a single command (stored procedure)  
- do so manually, meaning it won’t be scheduled and there won’t be any Snowpipes  
- dynamically determine the warehouse size, if a file is over 10KB they want to use a small warehouse, anything under that size should be handled by an xsmall warehouse.
```
-- skeleton script:
-- Create the warehouses
create warehouse if not exists my_xsmall_wh 
    with warehouse_size = XSMALL
    auto_suspend = 120;
    
create warehouse if not exists my_small_wh 
    with warehouse_size = SMALL
    auto_suspend = 120;

-- Create the table
create or replace table <table_name>
(
    date_time datetime,
    trans_amount double
);

-- Create the stage
create or replace stage week_10_frosty_stage
    url = 's3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_10/'
    file_format = <enter_file_format>;

-- Create the stored procedure
create or replace procedure dynamic_warehouse_data_load(stage_name string, table_name string)
<code goes here>

-- Call the stored procedure.
call dynamic_warehouse_data_load('week_10_frosty_friday_stage', '<table_name>');
```


### Result
When you execute the last line of the above script “call dynamic_warehouse_data_load()” then you should get the following result.  
![table showing 4000 rows added](https://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/result_screenshot.png)  
And when querying the QUERY_HISTORY, you should see that different warehouses were used for different files.
