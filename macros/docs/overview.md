{% docs __overview__ %}
This is my attempt to tackle the [Snowflake Frosty Friday Challenges](https://frostyfriday.org/) using dbt --regardless of whether this is the right tool or not for these challenges!  

This means that sometimes there're funny ways that macros are being called or used that one wouldn't necessarily expect to use in real life (e.g. setting up the snowflake instance is __typically__ something separated from the ELT jobs).
