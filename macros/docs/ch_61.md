## My solution:
- Create a stage to read from the file.
- Transform the data to match expectations.  
- Create a stage to save the file to with encryption enabled.
- Get_presigned_url to share

Welcome to the Frosty Friday Challenge! I’m Dorian Banutoiu from canonicalized.com, and I’ve got an
exciting challenge for you.

Get ready to showcase your data wrangling skills and JSON manipulation prowess!

Challenge Details
Imagine you’re working at a Telecom company and your colleague Rick has sent you a spreadsheet
containing a list of products.


Your task is to clean up and transform this data into a Snowflake table and create a JSON file in a
specific format for Rick to upload to a third-party tool.

But there’s some cleaning up to do before the data can be used effectively. In his attempt to make the
spreadsheet pretty Rick merged some cells in the Brand column which of course will make your life
harder.

[Data File](s3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_61/Telecom Products – Sheet1.csv)

Tasks
Data Cleanup:
– Fill the null values in the “Brand” column with the value from the first non-empty row from
above (forward fill)
– Fill null values in the “Friendly URL” column with the corresponding URL from the second
column
– Remove rows with null values in the Category column.
JSON Object Creation:
– Transform the cleaned data into a nested JSON object using the following format
```
{
  "Category": {
    "Brand": [
      {"Product Name": "Friendly URL"}
    ],
  "Brand": [
    {"Product Name": "Friendly URL"},
    {"Product Name": "Friendly URL"}
  ]
},
  "Category": {
"Brand": [
    {"Product Name": "Friendly URL"}
  ]
},
...
}
```

Unload Data:
– Once the JSON object is created, unload the data into a JSON file to a Snowflake stage.
Send your colleague [a pre-signed link]() to the file.

Final Outputs:

Snowflake Table: A cleaned and transformed dataset that’s ready to be used by you and your
colleagues looking like the below screenshot


JSON File: A JSON file in the required format, suitable for Rick to upload into a third-party tool. Pay attention to the case of the Category column.

Tips

Window functions should make it easy to forward fill empty values in Snowflake
You can create a UDF to make it easy to covert the case of the Category values
Server-side encryption is required on the unload stage to be able to generate a pre-signed URL
Have fun!
