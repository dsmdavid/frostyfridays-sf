## My solution:
- Create the storage integration.
- Create the stage.
- Read the directory table.
- Use the relative_path to create the relevant file_url needed following [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-file)

## the prompt
Week 37
The Challenge
Recently, I’ve been training people for SnowPro Core exams and a lot of the feedback has been that unstructured data and various URLs has come up a lot. If you want to pass that exam, this challenge is probably the best challenge you can do!

We want you to create an external stage with a directory table, and query it. Each row should be accompanied by a:
– Scoped File URL: to give scoped access for internal uses
– Stage File URL: to give permanent access to a stage
– Pre-signed URL: to give external users access

Starting code:
```
create or replace storage integration week37_si
    type = external_stage
    storage_provider = 's3'
    storage_aws_role_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::184545621756:role/week37'
    enabled = true
    storage_allowed_locations = ('s3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_37/');
```
