## My solution:
- Create a base table to insert the values.
- Parse with multiple lateral flattens.
- ... getting different values (ok total distinct count --3000--, but the number of rows is not anywhere near...+32k instead of 28k...)

## the prompt
Week 16 – Intermediate
Tis Friday and what a wonderful day for flexing those JSON-parsing muscles!

Below we have the set up script:
```
create or replace file format json_ff
    type = json
    strip_outer_array = TRUE;
    
create or replace stage week_16_frosty_stage
    url = 's3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_16/'
    file_format = json_ff;

create or replace table <schema>.week16 as
select t.$1:word::text word, t.$1:url::text url, t.$1:definition::variant definition  
from @week_16_frosty_stage (file_format => 'json_ff', pattern=>'.*week16.*') t;
```

### Result
And below is what you should end up with if you were to run the following:
![table showing parsed results](https://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/end_result.png)

If correct, then (without the “where word like ‘l%'” filter) :

count(word) should get you 28,233 rows
count(distinct word) should get you 3000 rows
