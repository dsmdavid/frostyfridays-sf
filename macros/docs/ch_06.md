## My solution:
- Use the previous macro to create two stages:
  - One for exploration and retrieval of the headers (challenge_06_01).
  - Another to import the raw data.
- Create raw tables for the different file names (Snowflake was throwing some errors when trying to run everything as views from the stage):
  - nations -- **challenge_06_02**
  - constituencies -- **challenge_06_03**
- Create the polygons (include a copy of the initial point at the end `ST_MAKEPOLYGON: A GEOGRAPHY object that represents a LineString in which the last point is the same as the first (i.e. a loop)`.
- Aggregate the geometries to nation / constituency (disregard the part information) **challenge_06_0Xb**
- Cross join and intersect, followed by a count -- **challenge_06_04**

My result:

## the prompt
Week 6 – Hard
Posted on 2022-07-22 by Christopher Marland
This week we’re going to play with spatial functions. Frosty Lobbying is thinking of supporting some candidates in the next UK General Election. What they need is to understand the geographic spread of candidates by nation/region of the UK.

Your job is to build both the nations/regions and parliamentary seats into polygons, and then work out how many Westminster seats intersect with region polygons. 

Be wary that some seats may sit within two different regions, some may not sit within any (Northern Ireland is not included in the data provided) and some may just be awkward.

Note: Within the data, the ‘part’ column is an integer given to each landmass that makes up that region/nation/constituency – for example, the Isle of Mull could be ‘part 34’ of Scotland, and ‘part 12’ of the Argyll and Bute constituency.

You can find the nations are regions data [here](https://frostyfridaychallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/challenge_6/nations_and_regions.csv) and the Westminster constituency data [here](https://frostyfridaychallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/challenge_6/westminster_constituency_points.csv).
