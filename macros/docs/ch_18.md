## My solution:
- Spent a long time trying to do everything inside dbt.
- Gave up
- Created a notebook to train the model offline and push the udf to Snowflake
  
## the prompt
The Challenge
Inflation is rising! Today’s challenge is to predict future inflation using actual economic data from the Snowflake Data Marketplace. Specifically, you will train a linear regression model inside snowflake that predicts the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for any given future year! To answer this challenge, provide the PCE for the year 2024.

The Data
The data source: https://www.snowflake.com/datasets/knoema-economy-data-atlas/

Help / Hints / Tips
To view historical personal consumption data:

```
SELECT "Date", "Value" FROM "ECONOMY"."BEANIPA" 
WHERE "Table Name" = 'Price Indexes For Personal Consumption Expenditures By Major Type Of Product' 
AND "Indicator Name" = 'Personal consumption expenditures (PCE)' AND "Frequency" = 'A' 
ORDER BY "Date"
```

Expected Answer
This time, we’re not showing you the entire answer but a value from a previous year so that you’ve got a hint if you’re on the right track :
