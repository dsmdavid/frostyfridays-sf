## My solution:
- Create a prep stage with row_id.  
- Cross join filtering on row_ids.  
- Soundex to detect similarities.  

## the prompt
When a client calls, they give their name and our tech support checks it in the database. If the client can’t be found, a new client is created.

We thought we created a fool-proof system but alas, it is not so. If someone spells a name differently then they can’t be found! This news was so shocking that we’re tasking you to filter our database on those similar-sounding names.

And we expect you to find that row 1 and 2 are similar sounding , but row 5 and 6 are not

In the returned table, we’d like you to show that you’ve compared row 1 to row 2-14, but that row 2 is going to be checked against 3-14 (but not row 1 since you’ve already checked)

Starting code:  
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE week_60 (
    name VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO week_60 (name)
VALUES
    ('John Smith'),
    ('Jon Smyth'),
    ('Jane Doe'),
    ('Jan Do'),
    ('Michael Johnson'),
    ('Mike Johnson'),
    ('Sarah Williams'),
    ('Sara Williams'),
    ('Robert Brown'),
    ('Roberto Brown'),
    ('Emily White'),
    ('Emilie Whyte'),
    ('David Lee'),
    ('Davey Li');
```
