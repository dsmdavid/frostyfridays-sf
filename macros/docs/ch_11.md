## My solution:
- Create the stage
- Load the data
- Use post_hook to 
  - create or replace the tasks
  - execute the 1st task immediately
- Add a view on top to summarise the results
  
## the prompt
Week 11 – Basic
This week FrostyFarms are looking to create some a set of chained tasks – two to be exact! The farms have plenty of cows who produce milk for us, and from there, some of that milk will be converted into skim/skimmed milk. We want our data to be edited to reflect the fact that the fat percentage of the milk will determine how the data should look.

Skim milk goes through the process of fat reduction in a centrifuge, therefore, whole milky rows won’t need columns relating to that process, but the skim milky rows will.

Create a parent and child task that will perform different actions on the different rows of data depending on the fat percentage of the milk.

### RESULT

When you run the first query, the 3% data should look like

![table showing many nulls](https://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/milk3.png)

And the non-3% rows should look like

![table showing data](https://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/milk1_2.pnghttps://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/milk1_2.png)
Whilst the second query should produce something like
