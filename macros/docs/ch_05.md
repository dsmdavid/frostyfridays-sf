- Create a table with a single column  
- Create a view querying that table that uses an udf
  - Use a pre-hook to create the udf needed.

Week 5 – Basic  
Posted on 2022-07-15 by Christopher Marland  
This week, we’re using a feature that, at the time of writing, is pretty hot off the press :
*Python in Snowflake*.

To start out  create a simple table with a single column with a number, the size and amount are up to you,  

After that we’ll start with a very basic function: multiply those numbers by 3.

The challenge here is not ‘build a very difficult python function’ but to build and use the function in Snowflake.

We can test the code with a simple select statement :
```
SELECT timesthree(start_int)
FROM FF_week_5
```
