## My solution:
Create a stage as a macro inside the challenge_01 view
I consider also creating it as a hook on-run-start (which worked ok) and also as a pre-hook for the model (which I didn't get to work), but settled for a macro that can (potentially) actually be reused for other challenges
## the prompt
Week 1 – Basic

FrostyFriday Inc., your benevolent employer, has an S3 bucket that is filled with .csv data dumps. This data is needed for analysis. Your task is to create an external stage, and load the csv files directly from that stage into a table.

The S3 bucket’s URI is: s3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_1/
