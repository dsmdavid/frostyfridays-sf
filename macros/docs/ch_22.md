## My solution:
- Create RLS

## the prompt
Week 22 – Basic
The sales manager at Frosty Sales has no friends. Therefore, instead of giving each sales reps a list of cities, he decided to order them so that city-districts with an odd id belong to rep1, and even to rep2.

Your job is to create a secure view that will:

Ensure rep1 can only see city-districts with an odd id
Ensure rep2 can only see city-districts with an even id
The ‘id’ fields is actually a randomly generated id (so we can fulfil [secure view best practice](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-secure.html#sequence-generated-columns))
