## My solution:
- Create the share
- Keep points* within the Brooklyn boundary as potential central points.
- Keep points within 750m of the Brooklyn boundary as all candidates.
- Cross join and keep points within 750m of each other
- Keep central points that have > 3 other points nearby
- Group all points within 750 m of the central point and create a bounding box
- Combine everything, convert to wkt and plot...
  
*Points: I used the V_OSM_NY_AMENITY_OTHERS view instead of the NODES as that one has just too many points to play around.
Even with this smaller subset, I get loads of squares more than the proposed solution, so I must be missing something.

## the prompt
Week 17 – Intermediate
Brooklyn is having issues with a particular supergang : The rectangles.

They focus on controlling busy points within the city and carve out a particularly shaped area of influence: a rectangle. 1 point of interest, or node, is central to their operation, they control every other node within 750 meters.

They only seem to settle down if a node has at least 3 other nodes within 750 of a central node. This means that there will be at least 4 nodes in a group.

Data is contained within the OpenStreetMap New York (by Sonra) on the Snowflake Marketplace

Requirements

– connect to OpenStreetMap New York by Sonra
– If 3 nodes are within 750 meters of another central node, group these together.
– Build a rectangle containing these groups , 1 rectangle per group
– The central node should be within the city of Brooklyn (ignore the null values for the addr_city)
– Be able to plot all these rectangles on a single map using wkt formatting (search for wkt plotting to find these sites)
