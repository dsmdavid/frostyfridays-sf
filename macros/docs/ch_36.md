## My solution:
- Create a macro to set up the scenario.
- Create a macro to run as a `run-operation` to safe-remove objects
  - Check if the object has dependencies based on account_usage views.
  - Use the proper object type for the drop.
- Make it work for tables & views.

Use it as: `dbt run-operation safe_drop_36 --vars '{"ch36":"true"} --args '{database:<target_db>, schema: <target_schema>, table_name: <target_object>}'`

What happened above?
1. Tried to drop the table `ch36_table_1`. This failed as there are objects depending on it.
2. Tried to drop the view `ch36_view_1`. This succeeded as there were no dependencies.
3. Tried to drop the table `ch36_table_1` two times in a row. Both failed as the shared views do not have the latest data yet.
4. Wait until the shared views have sync'd the changes.
5. Tried to drop the table `ch36_table_1` two times in a row. Both succeeded (the first one with an actual drop, the second with an "already dropped" statement).

The Challenge
In the past, SuperHero Inc. has had some issues with losing data connection: SuperDataBoy (formerly known as InternDataLad) was a bit too overzealous with dropping tables, not knowing that a view was referencing it.

To help out SuperDataBoy, we’re going to create a mechanism that checks if a view is getting its information from a table that we’re about to drop. If there is a reliance, the table should not be dropped.

Let’s see if we can help SuperDataBoy out!

You can test your mechanism with this small piece of startup code that just creates a lot of tables/views :
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE table_1 (id INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_1 AS (SELECT * FROM table_1);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE table_2 (id INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_2 AS (SELECT * FROM table_2);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE table_6 (id INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_6 AS (SELECT * FROM table_6);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE table_5 (id INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_5 AS (SELECT * FROM table_5);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE table_4 (id INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_4 AS (SELECT * FROM table_4);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE table_3 (id INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_3 AS (SELECT * FROM table_3);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW my_union_view AS
SELECT * FROM table_1
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table_2
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table_3
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table_4
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table_5
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table_6;
```
