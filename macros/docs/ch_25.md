Week 25 – Beginner
The Challenge
In order to prepare a future ingestion flow of data, your organization wants to get data from a weather API into Snowflake. At the end of the flow, it is expected to create a fact table to be used by consumers. 

Your colleague Atzmon has already pulled a sample of the weather data from the API and momentarily stored it in an s3 bucket. The s3 bucket contains a JSON file with hourly data for 7 days. 

Your Flow will consist of 3 layers (schemas) of data:
a. Landing zone (external stage, raw table – weather_raw)
b. Curated zone (raw data parsed table – weather_parsed)
c. Consumption zone (aggregated data table – weather_agg)

Objectives: 
1. Create a stage for the landing layer and copy the JSON. 
2. Parse the JSON and create a table – weather_parsed (in the curated zone). 
3. Create a table for consumption weather_agg (in the consumption zone).     
The table should have aggregates per day for: 
a. Temperature       
b. Wind speed       
c. Distinct ‘icon’ definitions for a day (e.g. [“cloudy”, “rain”])

[Here's the link](https://frostyfridaychallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/challenge_25/ber_7d_oct_clim.json)  to the s3 bucket (hint: bucket = frostyfridaychallenges, path = challenge_25).
Good luck!
