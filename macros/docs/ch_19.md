## My solution:
- Create a calendar dim table using dbt_utils for the spine
- Create a udf to calculate number of days based on the calendar_dim table (that could include "holidays" info)

## the prompt
Week 19 – Basic
This week we’re looking at something quirky but useful: date dimension together with a UDF that calculates the number of business days between 2 dates (and because it’s an easy challenge, we’re not excluding holidays).

We’ve talked to the Superhero Union and have received complaints that the schedules for any given hero, doesn’t take into account a ‘normal working routine’ and that ‘even superheroes need weekends off’.

To start this venture, we need you to construct a date dimension table that contains the following : 

the date, starting from 1-1-2000
The year in 4 numbers (for 1-1-2000 this would be 2000)
The first 3 letters of the month (for 1-1-2000 this would be Jan)
The name of the month (for 1-1-2000 this would be January)       
The number of the day within that month   (for 1-1-2000 this would be 1)
The number of the weekday (Mondays are 1, Tuesdays are 2, etc., OR any other order that makes sense to you )
The number of the week in that year (for 1-1-2000 this would be 1)       
The number of the day in that year   (for 1-1-2000 this would be 1)
Besides the date dimension you should also create a function to calculate the number of business days between 2 dates that can easily switch between including or excluding the 2nd date in the calculation (so From and including Monday, 2 November 2020 to, but not including Friday, 6 November 2020 is 4 days
but From and including Monday, 2 November 2020 to and including Friday, 6 November 2020 is 5 days)

### Result
And below is what you should end up with if you were to run the following:
![table showing parsed results](https://frostyfriday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/end_result.png)

If correct, then (without the “where word like ‘l%'” filter) :

count(word) should get you 28,233 rows
count(distinct word) should get you 3000 rows
