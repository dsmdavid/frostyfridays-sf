## My solution:
- Create a base table to insert the values.
- Use lag with ignore nulls to fill missing info.

Week 13 – Basic Snowflake / Intermediate Non-Snowflake

This week we’ve got a bit of a deceptive problem that’s very easy to understand but tricky to execute in SQL.

Everyone has received data in the past that’s been perfectly legible for normal humans but useless for machines, a prime example of this is the following dataset from Superhero Inc. : 
![table](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5s7hyMx2fEkY8NxLk8XoSKZw2Q5dhzyEnm3tcWS6uy0KiKXvV-31SqUZ_-Zuwx6sFaRdQ704vxEP7QGq7KtSV49cNuHMoVJLejFGvo8HarFpDuiHCv8NE754dJnyGJ6g5vMe1mkxqa_VZTm233Al9xcyp-1e0VCKoZwjVcmzX_jnoEwI7A4kGRVamg)

The inventory management has been a bit spotty with irregular checks on different dates, and an inventory system that can really use some TLC.

We can easily extrapolate that the stock amount hasn’t been filled out because it hasn’t changed and that the previous value that HAS been filled out still applies.

Translating this into SQL however, is your challenge for today.

We would like to transform the above column, into the following :
![table with filled missing values](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ve0U3Dk8DquTbY3G030nNJ86-PHZoSpG56yJs60AgaGkV8dsrNe7jnj951SaA7mcrqRs12zaViFXJ24tidLO0zv685kMKEEEJJO3zdw20dBH30Je4v72WftPqbmG4qvKBhRvWetXpQKkFhZl90Dq1jxL3mYY9W2381fdcmkHR7QdFCBuOSGJrZF5cg)

We secretly know that Snowflake has a way to do this a bit more easily in comparison to other systems so if you REALLY want to challenge yourself, you can try to do it without any Snowflake-specific tools.
