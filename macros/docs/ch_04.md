## My solution:
- Use the macro from week 1 to create a new stage.  
- Retrieve the file as json,
flatten on house and flatten on monarch.  

I tried to be creative to extract the distinct keys inside the 'Monarchs' json for the different rows.  
It was a learning experience using object_keys, array_agg, and array_to_string but, eventually, a rabbit hole.

- so I ended up with a call_statement and some active editing...  

* the `coalesce` before the arrays is useful when the json is a string (i.e. there was only one spouse/nickname).  


## the prompt
Frosty Friday Consultants has been hired by the University of Frost’s history department; they want data on monarchs in their data warehouse for analysis. Your job is to take the JSON file located [here](https://frostyfridaychallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/challenge_4/Spanish_Monarchs.json), ingest it into the data warehouse, and parse it into a table that looks like this:  


- Separate columns for nicknames and consorts 1 – 3, many will be null.  
- An ID in chronological order (birth).  
- An Inter-House ID in order as they appear in the file.  
- There should be 26 rows at the end.  

### Result:

Your result should look like:
